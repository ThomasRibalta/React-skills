# React Skills

Welcome to the **React Skills** repository, a personal project to document and showcase my journey of learning **React v9**. This learning experience is entirely based on the **Frontend Masters** course, which is also available here: [Complete React v9 by Brian Holt](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v9/).

## Project Objectives

- Master the fundamental and advanced concepts of React v9.
- Understand and apply tools like **Vite** for building modern React applications.
- Follow a structured and guided approach to understanding React principles.
- Document my learning process with examples and projects.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into multiple subfolders, each representing a specific stage in the learning journey:

- **/01-basic-react**: Initial steps to learn the basics of React (without using Vite).
- **/02-vite-integration**: Introduction to using Vite for a React project.
- **/03-hooks**: Exploring React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and more.
- Additional folders will be added as the learning progresses.

Each subfolder contains its own project files, including:

- **src/**: Source code for that stage.
- **README.md**: Notes specific to the stage.
- Configuration files (if applicable).

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-skills.git
